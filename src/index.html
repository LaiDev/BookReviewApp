          <p class="book-Description">
            The Renegades are a syndicate of prodigies—humans with extraordinary
            abilities—who emerged from the ruins of a crumbled society and
            established peace and order where chaos reigned. As champions of
            justice, they remain a symbol of hope and courage to
            everyone...except the villains they once overthrew. Nova has a
            reason to hate the Renegades, and she is on a mission for vengeance.
            As she gets closer to her target, she meets Adrian, a Renegade boy
            who believes in justice—and in Nova. But Nova's allegiance is to the
            villains who have the power to end them both.
